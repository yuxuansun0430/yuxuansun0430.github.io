I began my academic journey in 2018 at Beijing University of Technology, where I earned a degree in Internet of Things. After graduating in 2022, I joined the Masterâ€™s program in Data Engineering at Southern Methodist University (SMU) and transitioned into the Ph.D. program in Computer Science after one year.

My research is centered on large language models (LLMs). Currently, I am working in the Data Science Infrastructure (DSI) Lab under the supervision of Professor Jia Zhang.
